1. Your traversal code is sweet. Short, clean, and awesome. For the next project you'll probably want one that can also 
perform replace.

2. Your compiler is relatively clean and easy to read. Execellent job separating the checks from the tree. This pattern
will pay dividends in the future. 

Nice job guys!

[Fix these up, though]
